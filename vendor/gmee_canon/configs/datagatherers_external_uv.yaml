# Non-canonical: optional DataGatherers to join external Universal Variables (UV) onto trades.
# Use after you produce uv artifacts via tools/premium_trial_pipeline.py.

# NOTE: you MUST set snapshot_id to the id created by the capture pipeline.
# Example:
#   python tools/premium_trial_pipeline.py ... -> prints snapshot_id
#   then update it here OR pass another config that sets it.
